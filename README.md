Open the file "index.html" with your browser to play the game.

Object of the game: get the player from the grass to the water,
multiple times, scoring as many points as possible.

You get points by reaching the water (100) or by traversing
a square that has a gem on it (100, 250 and 500 points).
Gems appear at random intervals.

Danger: if you get touched by a bug, you die. After you die
four times, the game is over. You are given the option of
playing again.
